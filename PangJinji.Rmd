## Prompt:

Asking good questions is a valuable skill to have - asking questions in an online setting is both easier and harder than asking questions in person: we can prepare to ask a question but we are also expected to prepare.
The links posted here give some advice on how to ask good questions:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

- [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

Follow these links and read through the advice given, then

1. **Pick at least one question from stackoverflow or the R help and answer it.**

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 



2. **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**

[Question I answered](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68276148/how-do-i-import-my-qz-files-from-illumina-sequencing-into-qiime2-via-a-manifest/70841244#70841244)


3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **

I first answered a question on stackoverflow and then read those reading materials. I was surprised that the question I answered was somehow an example of "good questions". First of all, the title of the question contains the software (qiime 2, a software that analyzes sequencing data) he used and explained the issue clearly. That's why I was able to see his question quickly after I signed up on stackoverflow. His question doesn't contain any minimal, reproducible example since it's not needed for his question, but he did included examples of his data files to show the data type. With those information, I was able to understand his question and tried to answer it. From this homework, I have learned that the title of the question should be clear and better contain the language or software name to let people who have experience with that language/software to have large probability to see the question. Also, a minimal, reproducible example is always welcomed when asking quesitons online.
